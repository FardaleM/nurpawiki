What is Nurpawiki?
------------------

Nurpawiki is a personal information manager (PIM) application that
combines a wiki, a to-do list and a simple scheduler to help you get
organized.  It aims to ease note taking and action planning.  Actions
(to-dos) are always associated with notes or plans (wiki pages).

Development
-----------

The application is written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and uses the
fantastic [Ocsigen web programming
framework](https://www.ocsigen.org/).  It runs in a web server and
uses SQL for persistence.  It can thus be hosted on Linux and used on
on Windows or any other web browser capable platform.
